@page wsdd_0 The wsdd library for WS-Discovery 1.0 and 1.1 support

@section wsdd_1 WS-Discovery Setup

The material in this section relates to the WS-Discovery specification.

To use the wsdd library:
-# Define WS-Discovery event handlers in your code, see Section @ref wsdd_2.
-# Use the wsdd API functions as described below.
-# (Re-)compile and link stdsoap2.c/pp or libgsoap, (dom.c/.cpp when needed),
   wsddapi.c, wsaapi.c and the soapcpp2-generated source files. Compile and link
   with plugin/threads.c when needed.

The material in this document pertains to the WS-Discovery protocol and model
and assumes that the reader is familiar with the WS-Discovery protocol, its
terms and definitions, and the WS-Discovery model. This document describes the
WS-Discovery interface to invoke and handle WS-Discovery events, while the
higher-level logic remains application-specific. Especially the mode of
operation, ad-hoc or managed with a Discovery Proxy, depends on the application
deployment and WS-Discovery support requirements.

The following assumptions are made. A Client is an endpoint that searches for
Target Service(s). A Target Service (TS) is and endpoint that makes itself
available for discovery. A Discovery Proxy (DP) is an endpoint that facilitates
discovery of Target Services by Clients. The interfaces defined in the wsdd
library can be used to implement Client, Target Service, and Discovery Proxy
operations.

WS-Discovery ad-hoc and managed modes are supported by the wsdd library. In an
ad-hoc mode discovery messages are sent multicast and response messages are
sent unicast.  In a managed mode discovery messages are sent unicast to a
Discovery Proxy.

@note The wsdl2h tool uses typemap.dat to auto-generate a gSOAP service
definitions header file that imports wsdd.h to support WS-Discovery 1.1 with
WS-Addressing 2005/08. The tool imports wsdd10.h to support WS-Discovery 1.0
with WS-Addressing 2004/08. To use WS-Discovery 1.0 with WS-Addressing 2005/08,
you will need to change typemap.dat to let wsdl2h import wsdd5.h (see comments
in typemap.dat).

@section wsdd_2 WS-Discovery Event Handlers

The following event handlers MUST be defined by the user to handle inbound
WS-Discovery messages. The event handlers receive notifications (Hello, Bye,
ProbeMatches, and ResolveMatches) or receive requests to provide data (Probe
and Resolve).

The event handlers to define are:
- @ref wsdd_event_Hello
- @ref wsdd_event_Bye
- @ref wsdd_event_Probe
- @ref wsdd_event_ProbeMatches
- @ref wsdd_event_Resolve
- @ref wsdd_event_ResolveMatches

See the documentation provided with each of these functions in wsddapi.h.

@section wsdd_3 WS-Discovery Event Listener

Inbound WS-Discovery multicast messages are handled via a listener on a port.
The user-defined event handlers are invoked when WS-Discovery messages arrive
on the port.

The @ref soap_wsdd_listen function listens on the current port opened with
soap_bind for WS-Discovery messages for a brief time period as specified by a
timeout value in seconds (negative for micro seconds). The function allows for
periodically polling the port as shown:

@code
#include "wsddapi.h"
int port = 8080;
struct soap *soap = soap_new();
soap->user = (void*)&my_state;
if (!soap_valid_socket(soap_bind(soap, port, 100)))
{ soap_print_fault(soap, stderr);
  exit(0);
}

soap_wsdd_listen(soap, -1000); // listen for messages for 1 ms

soap_wsdd_listen(soap, -1000); // listen for messages for 1 ms
...
@endcode

WS-Discovery messages are relayed to the event handlers. The soap->user pointer
can be used to point to a state object that is updated by the event handlers as
per desired behavior at the Client side, the Target Service, or the Discovery
Proxy implementation.

@section wsdd_4 Invoking WS-Discovery Operations

A Client may invoke the following WS-Discovery operations:
- @ref soap_wsdd_Probe
- @ref soap_wsdd_Resolve

A Target Service may invoke the following WS-Discovery
operations:
- @ref soap_wsdd_Hello
- @ref soap_wsdd_Bye
- @ref soap_wsdd_ProbeMatches (automatic via @ref soap_wsdd_listen)
- @ref soap_wsdd_ResolveMatches (automatic via @ref soap_wsdd_listen)

A Discovery Proxy can perform all operations listed above, and should use
"wsdd:DiscoveryProxy" as the Type with the Hello, Bye, and ProbeMatches.

To send a Hello message to join a network:

@code
soap_wsdd_Hello(soap,
  SOAP_WSDD_MANAGED,    // or SOAP_WSDD_ADHOC for ad-hoc mode
  "to address",         // "http(s):" URL, or "soap.udp:" UDP, or TCP/IP address
  soap_wsa_rand_uuid(soap), // a unique message ID
  NULL,
  "my address",         // where they can find me for WS-Discovery
  "wsdd:DiscoveryProxy",// Types: I'm a DP
  NULL,                 // Scope
  NULL,                 // MatchBy
  NULL,                 // XAddrs
  75965);               // MDVersion
@endcode

Note that Types is a string with namespace-qualified names (QNames). These
should be qualified as in "namespace":name or you can use a namespace prefix
that is part of your namespace table (in the .nsmap). So you can use
"wsdd:DiscoveryPRoxy" as a QName in Types because wsdd is a namespace prefix
with a defined binding in the namespace table.

For UDP multicast, use

@code
soap.connect_flags = SO_BROADCAST;
@endcode

and optionally set the interface and TTL settings:

@code
in_addr_t addr = inet_addr("1.2.3.4");
soap.ipv4_multicast_if = &addr; // see setsockopt IPPROTO_IP IP_MULTICAST_IF
soap.ipv6_multicast_if = addr; // multicast sin6_scope_id
soap.ipv4_multicast_ttl = 1; // see setsockopt IPPROTO_IP, IP_MULTICAST_TTL
@endcode

Please refer to the socket options for IPPROTO_IP IP_MULTICAST_IF to specify
the default interface for multicast datagrams to be sent from. Otherwise,
the default interface set by the system administrator will be used (if any).

Please refer to the socket options for IPPROTO_IP IP_MULTICAST_TTL to limit
the lifetime of the packet. Multicast datagrams are sent with a default value
of 1, to prevent them to be forwarded beyond the local network. This parameter
can be set between 1 to 255.

To send a Bye message to leave a network:

@code
soap_wsdd_Bye(soap,
  SOAP_WSDD_MANAGED,    // or SOAP_WSDD_ADHOC for ad-hoc mode
  "to address",         // "http(s):" URL, or "soap.udp:" UDP, or TCP/IP address
  soap_wsa_rand_uuid(soap), // a unique message ID
  NULL,
  "my address",         // where they can find me for WS-Discovery
  "wsdd:DiscoveryProxy",// Types: I'm a DP
  NULL,                 // Scope
  NULL,                 // MatchBy
  NULL,                 // XAddrs
  75965);               // MDVersion
@endcode

To send a Probe message (see WS-Discovery 1.1 Section 1.7) and then listen to
ProbeMatches:

@code
struct soap soap = soap_new(); // to invoke messages
struct soap serv = soap_new(); // for the listener and event handlers

soap_bind(serv, port, 100);

const char *id = soap_wsa_rand_uuid(soap);
serv->user = (void*)&my_state;
my_state.probe_id = id;

soap_wsdd_Probe(soap,
  SOAP_WSDD_ADHOC,      // ad-hoc mode
  SOAP_WSDD_TO_TS,      // to a TS
  "to address",         // address of TS
  id,                   // message ID
  NULL,                 // ReplyTo
  "\"http://printer.example.org/2003/imaging\":PrintBasic",
  "ldap:///ou=engineering,o=examplecom,c=us",
  "http://docs.oasis-open.org/ws-dd/ns/discovery/2009/01/ldap");

soap_wsdd_listen(serv, -1000);
@endcode

The id is the WS-Addressing message ID that will be included in the
ProbeMatches RelatesTo WS-Addressing header. As an example, my_state is set to
this id so that when the @ref wsdd_event_ProbeMatches event handler is invoked
it can find the id in the current state that is pointed to by serv->user
(soap->user in the handler).

To send a Resolve message and then listen to ResolveMatches:

@code
struct soap soap = soap_new(); // to invoke messages
struct soap serv = soap_new(); // for the listener and event handlers

soap_bind(serv, port, 100);

const char *id = soap_wsa_rand_uuid(soap);
serv->user = (void*)&my_state;
my_state.resolve_id = id;

soap_wsdd_Resolve(soap,
  SOAP_WSDD_ADHOC,      // ad-hoc mode
  SOAP_WSDD_TO_TS,      // to a TS
  "to address",         // address to send to
  id,                   // message ID
  NULL,                 // ReplyTo
  "endpoint");          // EndpointReference of TS
 
soap_wsdd_listen(serv, -1000);
@endcode

Again, the id and state are used to associate the asynchronously received
ResolveMatches response that is handled by the @ref wsdd_event_ResolveMatches
for the original request.

In managed mode with unicast messages (request-response messages), the @ref
soap_wsdd_Probe and @ref soap_wsdd_Resolve are sufficient to invoke without
setting up a listener. The event handlers are invoked when the unicast response
message arrives.

In managed mode, the ProbeMatches and ResolveMatches are automatically sent via
@ref soap_wsdd_listen and the event @ref wsdd_event_Probe and @ref
wsdd_event_Resolve handlers. These event handlers should set the matches to be
returned.

In ad-hoc mode, ProbeMatches or ResolveMatches responses are NOT sent
automatically. In ad-hoc mode the responses can be returned by adding code to
the event handler or from anywhere in the main program, for example after @ref
soap_wsdd_listen. When responses are to be returned from the event handler or
from the main program, you should invoke @ref soap_wsdd_ProbeMatches and @ref
soap_wsdd_ResolveMatches to explicitly send unicast messages with the match(es)
back to the clients. The WS-Addressing ReplyTo address can be used as the
return address (when not anonymous), or by using the peer's host information
that is accessible in the soap->peer and soap->peerlen members. For example:

@code
char host[1024], port[16];
getnameinfo((struct sockaddr*)&soap->peer, soap->peerlen, host, sizeof(host), port, 16, NI_DGRAM | NI_NAMEREQD | NI_NUMERICSERV);
@endcode

@section wsdd_5 Generating C++ Server Objects

The WSDD library is developed to support C and C++. To support C++ server
objects generated with soapcpp2 options -i and -j, you need to define in your
C++ code the following wrappers (use this->soap below for soapcpp2 option -j):

@code
int wsddService::Hello(struct wsdd__HelloType *hello)
{ return __wsdd__Hello(this, hello);
}
int wsddService::Bye(struct wsdd__ByeType *bye
{ return __wsdd__Bye(this, bye);
}
int wsddService::Probe(struct wsdd__ProbeType *probe)
{ return __wsdd__Probe(this, probe);
}
int wsddService::ProbeMatches(struct wsdd__ProbeMatchesType *matches)
{ return __wsdd__ProbeMatches(this, matches);
}
int wsddService::Resolve(struct wsdd__ResolveType *resolve)
{ return __wsdd__Resolve(this, resolve);
}
int wsddService::ResolveProbeMatches(struct wsdd__ResolveMatchesType *matches)
{ return __wsdd__ResolveMatches(this, matches);
}
@endcode

Another approach to generate the WSDD service operations is to run soapcpp2
separately on wsdd.h (or wsdd5.h or wsdd10.h for WS-Discovery 1.0) by soapcpp2
-a -L -pwsdd wsdd.h to generate wsddService.cpp. Then chain the service
operations at the server side:

@code
if (soap_begin_serve(service.soap) == SOAP_OK)
  if (service.dispatch() == SOAP_NO_METHOD)
    soap_serve_request(service.soap);
@endcode

where the 'service' object is an instance of the application services generated
by soapcpp2 -j.

@section wsdd_6 Miscellaneous

You MUST generate client-side operations that the WSDD library expects to be
linked with, by executing:

@code
> soapcpp2 -L -pwsdd -Iimport import/wsdd.h
@endcode

Then compile and link the generated wsddClient.cpp code with your project.

Because WS-Addressing may relay faults to a FaultTo service, you need to
define a SOAP Fault service operation to accept and handle these:

@code
int SOAP_ENV__Fault(struct soap *soap, char *faultcode, char *faultstring, char *faultactor, struct SOAP_ENV__Detail *detail, struct SOAP_ENV__Code *SOAP_ENV__Code, struct SOAP_ENV__Reason *SOAP_ENV__Reason, char *SOAP_ENV__Node, char *SOAP_ENV__Role, struct SOAP_ENV__Detail *SOAP_ENV__Detail)
{ 
  ... = faultcode; // SOAP 1.1 fault code string (QName)
  ... = faultstring; // SOAP 1.1 fault string
  ... = faultactor; // SOAP 1.1 fault actor string
  ... = detail; // SOAP 1.1 fault detail struct
  ... = SOAP_ENV__Code; // SOAP 1.2 fault code struct
  ... = SOAP_ENV__Reason; // SOAP 1.2 reason struct
  ... = SOAP_ENV__Node; // SOAP 1.2 node string
  ... = SOAP_ENV__Role; // SOAP 1.2 role string
  ... = SOAP_ENV__Detail; // SOAP 1.2 detail struct
  return SOAP_OK;
}
@endcode
