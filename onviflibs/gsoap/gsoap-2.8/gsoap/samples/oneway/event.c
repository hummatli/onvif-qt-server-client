	event.c

	C-style eventing client

	Events are based on one-way SOAP messaging using HTTP keep-alive for
	persistent connections.

	The 'synchronous' global flag illustrates SOAP one-way messaging,
	which requires an HTTP OK or HTTP Accept response with an empty body to
	be returned by the server.

	Copyright (C) 2000-2002 Robert A. van Engelen. All Rights Reserved.

	Compile:
	soapcpp2 -c event.h
	cc -o event event.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapClient.c

	Run (first start the event handler on localhost port 18000):
	event
