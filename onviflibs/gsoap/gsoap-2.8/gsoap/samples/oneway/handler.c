/*
	handler.c

	Multi-threaded stand-alone event handler service

	Events are based on one-way SOAP messaging using HTTP keep-alive for
	persistent connections

	The 'synchronous' global flag illustrates SOAP one-way messaging,
	which requires an HTTP OK response with an empty body to be returned
	by the server.

	Copyright (C) 2000-2007 Robert A. van Engelen. All Rights Reserved.

	Compile:
	soapcpp2 -c event.h
	cc -o handler handler.c stdsoap2.c soapC.c soapService.c

	Run:
	handler 18000 &

	Server will time out after 24hr of inactivity

	This code enables keep-alive support which can cause "broken pipes"
	when the client prematurely closes the connection while indicating
	it wants the connection to stay alive. Broken pipes (SIGPIPE) can be
	fixed using MSG_NOSIGNAL, SO_NOSIGPIPE, or with a signal handler,
	but this is not very portable (see code below)
